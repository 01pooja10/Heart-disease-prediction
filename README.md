We all know that machine learning is currently used widely in various sectors like healthcare, automotive, financial services, retail, education, transportation, etc.
When talking about the healthcare sector, machine learning has disrupted the domain in terms of the vast number of applications it can be used for.
It is used in disease identification/diagnosis, robotic surgery, predicting epidemic outbreaks or even in the latest clinical trials/research.
One such important application is, predicting the presence of heart disease in human beings, given certain features or parameters.
The model we are going to be dealing with in this blog will be a “classification model” that makes predictions using binary values (0 or 1).
